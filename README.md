## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christopher and I recently completed my Master's in Information Systems Management at TU Berlin. I am passionate about developing digital solutions that empower people to live healthier lives. 
Whether it's app or web development, data analysis, or ML engineering, I use these tools to create projects like habit and workout tracking apps that help you achieve your health and fitness goals.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a workout tracking app using deep learning and smartphone sensors
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TensorFlow, AWS, Node.js

Check out my gamified habit tracking app here https://drhu-app.de/
